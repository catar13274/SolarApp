# API URL for the backend
# 
# IMPORTANT: For production builds served by nginx, LEAVE THIS EMPTY!
# nginx will handle API proxying via the /api endpoint.
# 
# Development: Leave empty to use Vite's development proxy (recommended)
# Production with nginx: Leave empty - nginx proxies /api to backend
# Production standalone: Set to your backend URL (e.g., http://your-server:8000)
# 
# DO NOT use hardcoded IP addresses (e.g., http://192.168.x.x) unless you have
# a specific reason. Hardcoded IPs will cause the app to fail when the IP changes.
# 
# Examples:
# VITE_API_URL=                    # Empty (recommended for nginx deployments)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Development override
# VITE_API_URL=/api               # Use relative path (works with nginx proxy)
# 
VITE_API_URL=
